Unless otherwise specified, the provisions of these terms apply to all users who send and receive information to and from hotomoe.

### User Rights
This section applies only to local users. Additionally, if a user is both a local user and a remote user, it applies only to the account designated as a local user.

hotomoe users have the right to use the service without discrimination based on gender, race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, political orientation, etc., and they have the right to freely write notes as long as the content is not restricted by this service, in accordance with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

hotomoe will make every effort to guarantee the rights of local users and protect them. Accounts that are not otherwise restricted have the right to enjoy these protective measures.

hotomoe does not restrict local users from communicating with other users, and the right to freely communicate is guaranteed. However, there may be restrictions on communication if the user or the remote instance to which the user belongs is restricted according to these regulations or internal guidelines.

hotomoe local users have the right to appeal moderation actions taken on hotomoe, and unless otherwise specifically notified, appeals can be made freely. However, users must comply with their obligations.

hotomoe local users have the right to protection if they have not violated any obligations, have not violated the laws of the jurisdiction in which hotomoe is located, and if legal requests are made that do not apply to hotomoe due to violations of other countries' laws.

### User Obligations
hotomoe users must not discriminate based on gender, race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, political orientation, etc.

hotomoe users, regardless of their country of residence, must not post content that violates United States federal law and the laws of the State of Wyoming.

hotomoe users who publish public notes must comply with the regulations of the 'relay' service, which automatically sends and receives public notes from ActivityPub or other hotomoe-compatible protocols in which hotomoe participates. The list of participating relays is disclosed via addresses accessible within the hotomoe service.

When appealing moderation actions, users must do so through official channels that can maintain confidentiality, and any requests violating this requirement will be considered attacks on the moderators and hotomoe. Additionally, all appeals by users who do not have the right to appeal will be dismissed.

If a user attacks moderators, operators, or other individuals or entities involved in the operation of hotomoe, hotomoe may take necessary actions against such users through the decision of moderators or operators with authority. This may include but is not limited to actions within the hotomoe service and legal measures.

## Disclaimer

All posts by accounts not managed by the operating entity on the hotomoe service do not represent the official position of hotomoe.

The hotomoe service is operated by an entity located in Wyoming, USA, and is primarily operated in Korean due to a significant number of Korean-speaking users. However, the laws of South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea do not apply to this service.

Even if the operating entity does not take immediate action when a hotomoe user violates these terms, this does not mean the related rights have been waived. If any part of these Terms of Service is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court or competent authority, the remainder of these terms will not be affected. You may not transfer these terms to anyone else without our written consent. We may transfer our rights to our affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in connection with the operation of our service.

All unofficial content exposed on hotomoe or transmitted from hotomoe has not been reviewed by the operating entity, and viewing such content is entirely at the user's own risk. The operating entity assumes no responsibility for this.

If you reside in the United States, you agree to proceed with any claims against the operating entity in your individual capacity only, as a plaintiff or class member, and not as a class or representative action unless the operating entity provides written consent to participate in a class action settlement. This subsection does not prevent the operating entity from participating in a class action settlement.
