## hotomoe Advertising Policy
Entities that comply with the following policies are permitted to place advertisements on hotomoe.

## Advertisement Regulations by Type
### General
You may not promote other ActivityPub instances or advertise the addresses of other ActivityPub instances.

Advertisements that violate hotomoeâ€™s Terms of Service are not permitted.

### User Accounts
You are allowed to advertise specific accounts within ActivityPub. In this case, the advertisement image must be related to the account, and the target address for the advertisement must be the hotomoe address of the account in question.

If a third party places the advertisement, we will query the relevant account to confirm permission for the ad placement.

### Nonprofit Organizations
Nonprofit organizations may only place advertisements if the request is made directly by an authorized representative. The target address for the advertisement is limited to the official address of the nonprofit organization (including ActivityPub user account addresses).

Doujin circles and similar groups are considered nonprofit organizations, but if the activity is highly commercial in nature, the ad may be reclassified as a commercial advertisement.

### Nonprofit Websites
Nonprofit websites may only place advertisements if the request is made directly by an authorized representative.

If the website contains ads or accepts donations, it will only be recognized as nonprofit if financial transparency is ensured.

### Commercial Advertisements (All advertisements not listed above)
Commercial advertisements restricted by U.S. law cannot be placed, but other advertisements are allowed, provided they do not infringe on the rights of others.

## Pricing
Advertisement fees on hotomoe are collected by a third party, Cocoa, and as a result, some information is shared with the entity. Per their request, all payments are processed in KRW (South Korean Won), though international brand cards are accepted.

All prices are exclusive of VAT.
